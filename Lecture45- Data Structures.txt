What is Data Structure?
--> A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

Classification of Data Structure
-->Linear data structure: Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 
Examples of linear data structures are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.
Static data structure: Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. 
An example of this data structure is an array.
Dynamic data structure: In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. 
Examples of this data structure are queue, stack, etc.
